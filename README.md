## You say he's under construction, what can I expect in the future?

You can expect some moderation coming in v1, as this bot is targeted for those who want to implement a moderation bot.
We will also add some fun commands, maybe some music and a currency/levelling system. This is subject to how far the bot is at and what it is capable of.

## Can I get these features early?

Yeah sure, why not? We deploy features on the Premium bot early, plus you get lots of other perks like a special role in the Support Server and shorter cooldowns.  
You will need to make a payment on Patreon to support us in order to get the Premium bot.
